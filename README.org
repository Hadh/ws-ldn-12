** Building

This repo contains a flexible =Makefile= to build all included
projects. The setup features:

- easily customizable device config & linker scripts
- no requirement to manually copy STM Cube SDK sources
- catalog file(s) to selectively exclude various SDK source files (see
  [[./make/sources.txt][/make/sources.txt]], can be overridden per project)
- config flags to include USBH & FatFs middlewares
- support for multiple sub-projects (with & without shared sources)
- individual module (sub-project) configs (e.g. [[./make/modules/ex01.make][/make/modules/ex01.make]])
- separate build & target folders for each module

Currently only the STM32F746-DISCO board is supported, but additional
board configurations can be easily added (see [[./make/devices/][/make/devices/]] for
reference).

*IMPORTANT:* The =Makefile= requires the env var =STM_CUBE_HOME= to be
set to the root of your STM SDK directory, e.g.
=~/dev/arm/STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.4.0=.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export STM_CUBE_HOME=~/dev/arm/STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.4.0

  make module=ex01 clean
  make module=ex01 -j4

  # flash device
  st-flash --reset write bin/ex01/app.bin 0x8000000
#+END_SRC
